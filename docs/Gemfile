# This gem includes Jekyll 3.9 and the remote-theme plugin automatically
gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins

# Optional: You can keep this if you want, but strictly speaking,
# if you are using 'remote_theme' in your config, you don't even need this line.
# However, keeping it is usually harmless.
